**Boilerplate**

Plaid builds the infrastructure and partnerships that securely connect financial institutions, consumers, and businesses. 
We make it easier and safer to use financial data, helping businesses mitigate risk, prevent fraud, reduce friction, and process transactions.


**Bringing finance into the modern era**

Plaid sits at the intersection of—and builds a bridge between—finance and technology. 
We take this responsibility seriously. As a company, our highest priority is to security. 
Plaid complies with PCI and SSAE No. 16 SOC 2 regulations, and we regularly subject ourselves to independent security tests. 
Plaid is known for its strong partnerships, best-in-class technological infrastructure, and commitment to making financial services simpler and more secure.

 

**Relentless commitment to excellence**

We believe that marrying technology and knowledge is the best way to bring meaningful progress to finance. 
Our API is both intuitive and comprehensive: built by developers, for developers, and our focus on user experience and technical innovation translates to a strong security posture. 
Our product portfolio is oriented toward solving real-world challenges—the types of challenges that every company that interacts with financial data and accepts payments has encountered. 
We are proud to have built relationships with some of the largest financial institutions in the world as well as a new class of applications. 
Together, we are powering innovation in the world of financial services.

**How Plaid came to be**

Plaid was founded in 2012 by William Hockey and Zach Perret. 
They were working on a card-linked application when they were confronted with the lack of ways to securely interface with financial institutions and consumers, and resolved to change the status quo.  

**Who we are**  
Plaid is made by 30+ people passionate about improving finance. 
The company is headquartered in the Financial District of San Francisco. 
Our investors include NEA, Spark Capital, Google Ventures, Felicis Ventures, Box Group, and Homebrew Capital.

**FOR BUSINESSES**

**Advertising, promotional, and sales materials**

Plaid supports its customers in their marketing efforts.

We appreciate it when you check with us before using Plaid’s brand materials (such as our name, logos, or screenshots) for commercial use or in referring to Plaid and how we work together in press materials or interviews.

Email pr@plaid.com with details about your intended use, preferably including mockups or drafts, and we’ll get back to you as quickly as possible.

**Proper use of Plaid’s brand materials**

In general, refrain from using Plaid’s name, logos, or screenshots in ways that may be misleading or confusing, or inappropriately suggest our affiliation or endorsement.

Please use only our current logo and approved screenshots,[ available here](https://github.com/plaid/press/blob/master/Plaid%20Press%20Kit.zip?raw=true). Don’t modify, add to, or replace them with images of your own. Consider spacing when depicting our logo. To maximize legibility, the logo should not be depicted at fewer than 50 pixels, and the clear space around the logotype should be equal to the height of the letters.
